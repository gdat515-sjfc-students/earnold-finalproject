Final project

Statement of Work: My final project will use visualization to explore national election data. Using a combination of publically available polling data and campaign finance information, I will show a series of charts which attempt to uncover the relationship between a candidate's funding their public image according to polling data. 

Problem Statement: The main question to be answered is whether candidates with more funding perform better in polls, or if the relationship between money and approval is more nuanced than that. The analysis will be useful for understanding a critical aspect of political elections through clear and objective visualization of data already available to the public. It could potentially be used to defend more limits on campaign financing, or help inform election reform.

Technical Objectives:
Environment: I will use an Rmarkdown document to create an interactive flexdashboard.
Data Sources: This data was sourced from the FEC (for contribution information) and from FiveThirtyEight (polling data).
Primary Package Dependencies: Tidyverse (ggplot2, dplyr, plotly) and Stringr
